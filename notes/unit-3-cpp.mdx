# C++ Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Tutorial

## Object-Oriented Analysis

### 1. Object-Oriented Design
Object-oriented design focuses on the system's structure through objects, which represent real-world entities.

#### Key Concepts
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential characteristics.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Car {
private:
    std::string model;
    int year;

public:
    Car(std::string m, int y) : model(m), year(y) {}

    void display() const {
        std::cout << "Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car("Toyota", 2020);
    car.display(); // Output: Model: Toyota, Year: 2020
    return 0;
}
```
### 2. Object Design
Object design involves defining how objects will interact and collaborate within the system.

Example:
```cpp
class Engine {
public:
    void start() {
        std::cout << "Engine started" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Car {
private:
    Engine engine;

public:
    void start() {
        engine.start();
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car;
    car.start(); // Output: Engine started
    return 0;
}
```
### 3. Combining Three Models
Combine conceptual, specification, and implementation models to create a complete design.

### 4. Designing Algorithms
Develop algorithms that work effectively with the designed objects.

Example of a Simple Sorting Algorithm:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void sortNumbers(std::vector<int>& numbers) {
    std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
}
```
### 5. Design Optimization
Refine your design to improve performance and maintainability. Consider time and space complexities.

### 6. Implementation of Control
Use control structures to manage the flow of execution in your program.

### 7. Adjustment of Inheritance
Modify inheritance hierarchies to ensure derived classes properly extend base classes.

### 8. Object Representation
Choose appropriate data types and structures for representing objects in memory.

### 9. Physical Packaging
Organize your code into files and modules to enhance readability and maintainability.

### 10. Documenting Design Considerations
Keep thorough documentation to clarify design decisions and thought processes.

## Structured Analysis and Structured Design (SA/SD)
### Jackson Structured Development (JSD)
JSD is a method for structured programming that emphasizes data flow and processes, integrated with object-oriented concepts.

## Mapping Object-Oriented Concepts Using Non-Object-Oriented Language
### 1. Translating Classes into Data Structures
In non-object-oriented languages, classes can be represented as structs or records.

Example:
```cpp
struct Account {
    double balance;
};
```
### 2. Passing Arguments to Methods
You can pass objects or references to methods for processing.

Example:
```cpp
void processAccount(Account& account) {
    account.balance += 100; // Depositing $100
}
```
### 3. Implementing Inheritance
Use inheritance to create new classes based on existing ones.

Example:
```cpp
class BaseAccount {
protected:
    double balance;

public:
    BaseAccount(double initialBalance) : balance(initialBalance) {}
};

class SavingsAccount : public BaseAccount {
private:
    double interestRate;

public:
    SavingsAccount(double initialBalance, double rate)
        : BaseAccount(initialBalance), interestRate(rate) {}

    void applyInterest() {
        balance += balance * interestRate;
    }
};
```
### 4. Associations and Encapsulation
Define relationships between classes and encapsulate data to protect it.

Example:
```cpp
class Bank {
private:
    std::vector<BaseAccount> accounts;

public:
    void addAccount(const BaseAccount& account) {
        accounts.push_back(account);
    }
};
```
## Object-Oriented Programming Style
### 1. Reusability
OOP promotes reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.

Example:
```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void honk() {
        std::cout << "Vehicle honk!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void honk() override {
        std::cout << "Car honk!" << std::endl;
    }
};
```
### 2. Extensibility
Easily extend existing classes without modifying them, which promotes maintainability.

### 3. Robustness
Encapsulation and error handling contribute to robust software designs.

### 4. Programming in the Large
Focus on managing larger systems through modular design and clear interfaces.

### 5. Procedural vs. OOP
Procedural Programming: Emphasizes procedures or routines.
Object-Oriented Programming: Centers around objects that combine data and behavior.
### 6. Object-Oriented Language Features
C++ provides features like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### 7. Abstraction and Encapsulation
- `Abstraction`: Hides complexity by exposing only necessary features.
- `Encapsulation`: Protects object data through access modifiers.
This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of object-oriented analysis and design principles in C++. By understanding these concepts and examples, you can effectively model and implement complex systems.
