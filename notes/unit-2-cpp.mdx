# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Tutorial

## Basic Structural Modeling

### 1. Classes
Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Car {
public:
    std::string model;
    int year;

    Car(std::string m, int y) : model(m), year(y) {}
    
    void display() {
        std::cout << "Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1("Toyota", 2020);
    car1.display(); // Output: Model: Toyota, Year: 2020
    return 0;
}
```
### 2. Relationships
Common relationships in OOP include:

- `Association`: A general connection between classes.
- `Aggregation`: A whole-part relationship where the part can exist independently.
- `Composition`: A strong whole-part relationship where the part cannot exist independently.
- `Inheritance`: One class inherits from another.
 Example of Composition:
```cpp
class Engine {
public:
    void start() { std::cout << "Engine started" << std::endl; }
};

class Car {
private:
    Engine engine; // Composition

public:
    void start() { engine.start(); }
};

int main() {
    Car car;
    car.start(); // Output: Engine started
    return 0;
}
```
### 3. Common Mechanisms
- `Encapsulation`: Protecting data through access modifiers.
- `Polymorphism`: Allowing methods to behave differently based on the object type.
### 4. Diagrams
- `Class Diagram`: Visual representation of classes and their relationships.
- `Object Diagram`: Represents instances of classes and their states.
## Class & Object Diagrams
### Terms and Concepts
- `Class`: A blueprint for creating objects.
- `Object`: An instance of a class.
- `Attributes`: Data members of a class.
- `Methods`: Functions defined within a class.
### Modeling Techniques
```cpp
class Person {
public:
    std::string name;
    int age;

    Person(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}
};

class Student : public Person {
public:
    std::string studentID;

    Student(std::string n, int a, std::string id) : Person(n, a), studentID(id) {}
};
```
## Collaboration Diagrams
### Terms and Concepts
Collaboration diagrams show how objects interact. Messages between objects are represented as function calls.

### Depicting a Message
```cpp
class Client {
public:
    void sendMessage() {
        std::cout << "Message sent from Client" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Server {
public:
    void receiveMessage(Client& client) {
        client.sendMessage();
        std::cout << "Message received by Server" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Client client;
    Server server;
    server.receiveMessage(client); 
    // Output: Message sent from Client
    //         Message received by Server
    return 0;
}
```
### Polymorphism in Collaboration Diagrams
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() {
        std::cout << "Animal sound" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        std::cout << "Bark" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        std::cout << "Meow" << std::endl;
    }
};

void makeSound(Animal* animal) {
    animal->speak();
}

int main() {
    Dog dog;
    Cat cat;
    makeSound(&dog); // Output: Bark
    makeSound(&cat); // Output: Meow
    return 0;
}
```
## Sequence Diagrams
###Terms and Concepts
Sequence diagrams show how objects interact over time.

### Depicting Asynchronous Messages
```cpp
void asyncCall(void (*callback)()) {
    std::cout << "Making async call..." << std::endl;
    callback(); // Call the callback
}

void onResponse() {
    std::cout << "Response received!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    asyncCall(onResponse); // Output: Making async call... Response received!
    return 0;
}
```
### Call-back Mechanism
The asyncCall function demonstrates a callback mechanism.

## Basic Behavioral Modeling
### 1. Use Cases
Use cases describe user interactions with the system and are documented separately.

### 2. Activity Diagrams
These are visualized using UML tools. You can represent activities in comments.

### 3. State Machine
Implementing a simple state machine in C++:

```cpp
enum State { OFF, ON };

class Light {
private:
    State state;

public:
    Light() : state(OFF) {}

    void toggle() {
        state = (state == OFF) ? ON : OFF;
        std::cout << (state == ON ? "Light is ON" : "Light is OFF") << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Light light;
    light.toggle(); // Output: Light is ON
    light.toggle(); // Output: Light is OFF
    return 0;
}
```
### 4. Process and Thread
C++11 introduced thread support with `<thread>`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void printMessage() {
    std::cout << "Hello from thread!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t(printMessage);
    t.join(); // Wait for the thread to finish
    return 0;
}
```
### 5. Events and Signals
Events can be handled with function pointers or callback mechanisms.

### 6. Time Diagram
Time-based behaviors can be implemented using timing functions or loops.

### 7. Interaction Diagram
Similar to collaboration diagrams, representing function calls and responses.

### 8. Package Diagram
Organizing classes into namespaces or files for better management.

## Architectural Modeling
### 1. Component Diagrams
Components can be represented as classes or modules.

### 2. Deployment Diagrams
Deployment involves representing how components are distributed across hardware, typically documented.

### Example of Component Diagram

|                  |
+------------------+
         |

|   Server Module  |
|                  |

```
