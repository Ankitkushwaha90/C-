# C++ Tutorial: Objects and Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

## 1. Objects and Classes in C++

### Basics of Object and Class in C++
In C++, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    string model;
    int year;

    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1;
    car1.brand = "Toyota";
    car1.model = "Corolla";
    car1.year = 2020;
    car1.displayInfo();
    return 0;
}
```
### Private and Public Members
- `Private members`: Can only be accessed by member functions of the class.
- `Public members`: Can be accessed from outside the class.
```cpp
class Person {
private:
    int age;
public:
    void setAge(int a) {
        age = a;
    }
    int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
};
```
### Static Data and Function Members
Static members are shared among all objects of the class.

```cpp
class Counter {
public:
    static int count;
    Counter() {
        count++;
    }
};
int Counter::count = 0;  // Initialize static member

int main() {
    Counter obj1, obj2;
    cout << "Count: " << Counter::count << endl;  // Outputs 2
    return 0;
}
```
### Constructors and Their Types
Constructors are special member functions that are called when an object is created.

```cpp
class Box {
public:
    int length, width;

    // Default constructor
    Box() : length(0), width(0) {}

    // Parameterized constructor
    Box(int l, int w) : length(l), width(w) {}
};
```
### Destructors
Destructors are used to free resources when an object goes out of scope.

```cpp
class Box {
public:
    ~Box() {
        cout << "Destructor called!" << endl;
    }
};
```
### Operator Overloading
You can redefine the behavior of operators.

```cpp
class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;

    Complex operator+(Complex const& obj) {
        Complex result;
        result.real = real + obj.real;
        result.imag = imag + obj.imag;
        return result;
    }
};
```
### Type Conversion
Converting between different types, either user-defined or built-in.

```cpp
class Distance {
public:
    int meters;
    Distance(int m) : meters(m) {}

    // Conversion operator to int
    operator int() {
        return meters;
    }
};
```
## 2. Inheritance in C++
### Concept of Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    void sound() {
        cout << "Some sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Woof!" << endl;
    }
};
```
### Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Base class" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {};
```
### Multiple Inheritance
```cpp
class Base1 {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Base1 class" << endl;
    }
};

class Base2 {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Base2 class" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {};
```
### Multilevel Inheritance
```cpp
class A {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Class A" << endl;
    }
};
class B : public A {};
class C : public B {};
```
### Hierarchical Inheritance
```cpp
class A {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Class A" << endl;
    }
};

class B : public A {};
class C : public A {};
```
### Hybrid Inheritance
```cpp
class A {};
class B : public A {};
class C : public A {};
class D : public B, public C {};  // Hybrid inheritance
```
### Protected Members
Protected members are accessible in derived classes but not from outside.

```cpp
class Base {
protected:
    int x;
public:
    void setX(int val) {
        x = val;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "X: " << x << endl;
    }
};
```
### Overriding
Derived classes can override methods from the base class.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Base display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override {
        cout << "Derived display" << endl;
    }
};
```
### Virtual Base Class
Avoids ambiguity in diamond inheritance.

```cpp
class A {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Class A" << endl;
    }
};

class B : virtual public A {};
class C : virtual public A {};
class D : public B, public C {};
```
### 3. Polymorphism in C++
Pointers in C++
Pointers allow for the storage and manipulation of memory addresses.

```cpp
int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int* p = &a;
    cout << *p;  // Outputs 10
    return 0;
}
```
### Pointers and Objects
Objects can also be pointed to using pointers.

```cpp
class Rectangle {
public:
    int length, width;

    Rectangle(int l, int w) : length(l), width(w) {}
    int area() {
        return length * width;
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle* rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
    cout << "Area: " << rect->area() << endl;
    delete rect;
    return 0;
}
```
### This Pointer
The this pointer refers to the current object instance.

```cpp
class Person {
public:
    Person* getThis() {
        return this;
    }
};
```
### Virtual Functions and Pure Virtual Functions
Virtual functions support dynamic (run-time) polymorphism.

```cpp

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Base class" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "Derived class" << endl;
    }
};
```
### Pure virtual functions enforce that derived classes must implement the function.

```cpp
Copy code
class Abstract {
public:
    virtual void show() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};
```
### Implementing Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {
        cout << "Drawing Shape" << endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shape = new Circle();
    shape->draw();  // Outputs "Drawing Circle"
    delete shape;
    return 0;
}
```
